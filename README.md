# Pipedrive Test

Simple test made using *Typescript*.

## Stack
 - Sqlite (all files are inside the db folder in the root directory)
 - Typescript

## How to run the project
```code
make start
```

## Unit Test
I've implemented Unit Test in the main functions to create the relationship. You can run the tests using the command:

```code
npm run test
```

And to check the coverage:

```code
npm run test:coverage
```

## Track the evolution
You can check the Project Evolution using the git commands. I've logged all progress.
